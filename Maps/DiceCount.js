 * Write a program in the following steps
    a. Roll a die and find the number between 1 to 6
    b. Repeat the Die roll and find the result each time
    c. Store the result in a dictionary
    d. Repeat till any one of the number has reached 10 times
    e. Find the number that reached maximum times and the one that was for minimum times
